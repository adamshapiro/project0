### Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My website is a brief look into some basics of espresso. The files used are as follows:

### HTML
---
* [index.html](/index.html): a basic table describing a simple espresso, a latte, and a cappuccino.

* [latte.html](/latte.html): a more in depth description of a latte.

* [cappuccino.html](/cappuccino.html): a more in depth description of a cappuccino.

* [glossary.html](/glossary.html): a glossary of terms related to making espresso drinks

### CSS
---
This website uses a sass file (styles.scss) which compiles into its only css file (styles.css)

### IMG
---
The site also uses a folder of three images, one for each drink on the table on the main page.
